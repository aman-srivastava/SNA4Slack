Oh, and it was on her instagram that I heard about this study group!). I'm very much from the 'tarot as a tool for real life' school of thinking; for me, psychic ability and fortune telling are just not part of it at all, rather tarot has been an amazing tool for introspection, gaining some clarity on both the mundane and the big stuff, cutting through BS, and seeing what choices might be out there for us that we hadn't even considered before.

Oh, and it was on her instagram that I heard about this study group!). I'm very much from the 'tarot as a tool for real life' school of thinking; for me, psychic ability and fortune telling are just not part of it at all, rather tarot has been an amazing tool for introspection, gaining some clarity on both the mundane and the big stuff, cutting through BS, and seeing what choices might be out there for us that we hadn't even considered before.

Plus I also run an Instagram account at @thehouseof. I see myself as a spiritual seeker with a weak spot for the archetypes of the Magician or the Druid. Which is why currently my path gravitates mostly around Hermeticism and Neodruidry, both Revival and (a tad) polytheist. I'm doing the Bardic course in the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids and the Dedicant Path in At nDraíocht Féin. Previously I've been a committed Catholic, studied Buddhism, Spiritualism, Daoism, Sufism and the likes, and even had an atheist phase. I work as a freelance copy/screen/ghostwriter and web developer. And as you all know, working in advertising sends you straight to hell. Meanwhile I like to be in my den at home playing urban hermit. Would love to build a career on top of my spiritual interests. Electronic, medieval, neofolk, post-punk music are my favourite genres, except for all the others. Eurovision Song Contest stuff for instance. I have always had a great curiosity for Tarot, but only got a deck for myself two years ago, and then I only started doing daily draws since March 1st.

I'm busy. 😉 I also have been slinging cards since I was in high school (that was...over two decades ago O_o), but always for myself and some very close friends and family. I'm a happy long-time amateur with no plans to go pro or monetize my tarot work. I read with the Universal Waite a lot, but have collected a lot of decks over the years and sometimes switch it up (though I am very RWS oriented). I do have a tarot blog, but not sure if it is cool to share links here. I love Benebell's work (I recently got a reading from her, and she is pretty dang amazing! Oh, and it was on her instagram that I heard about this study group!). I'm very much from the 'tarot as a tool for real life' school of thinking; for me, psychic ability and fortune telling are just not part of it at all, rather tarot has been an amazing tool for introspection, gaining some clarity on both the mundane and the big stuff, cutting through BS, and seeing what choices might be out there for us that we hadn't even considered before. I look forward to reading the book and learning along with all of you, and am excited to be a part of this thang!""","Apr 30, 2016 10:13"

I am the author of The House of THOT, a blog about spirituality and mythical living which I hope to bring back to life soon. https://thehouseofthot.com. Plus I also run an Instagram account at @thehouseof. I see myself as a spiritual seeker with a weak spot for the archetypes of the Magician or the Druid. Which is why currently my path gravitates mostly around Hermeticism and Neodruidry, both Revival and (a tad) polytheist. I'm doing the Bardic course in the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids and the Dedicant Path in At nDraíocht Féin. Previously I've been a committed Catholic, studied Buddhism, Spiritualism, Daoism, Sufism and the likes, and even had an atheist phase. I work as a freelance copy/screen/ghostwriter and web developer. And as you all know, working in advertising sends you straight to hell. Meanwhile I like to be in my den at home playing urban hermit. Would love to build a career on top of my spiritual interests. Electronic, medieval, neofolk, post-punk music are my favourite genres, except for all the others. Eurovision Song Contest stuff for instance. I have always had a great curiosity for Tarot, but only got a deck for myself two years ago, and then I only started doing daily draws since March 1st. I tend to be on the more analytical side of things concerning what Tarot is supposed to do. I own a RWS deck and on my wish list are the Centennial, Wild Unknown and Hermetic Tarot decks.

I'm busy. 😉 I also have been slinging cards since I was in high school (that was...over two decades ago O_o), but always for myself and some very close friends and family. I'm a happy long-time amateur with no plans to go pro or monetize my tarot work. I read with the Universal Waite a lot, but have collected a lot of decks over the years and sometimes switch it up (though I am very RWS oriented). I do have a tarot blog, but not sure if it is cool to share links here. I love Benebell's work (I recently got a reading from her, and she is pretty dang amazing! Oh, and it was on her instagram that I heard about this study group!). I'm very much from the 'tarot as a tool for real life' school of thinking; for me, psychic ability and fortune telling are just not part of it at all, rather tarot has been an amazing tool for introspection, gaining some clarity on both the mundane and the big stuff, cutting through BS, and seeing what choices might be out there for us that we hadn't even considered before. I look forward to reading the book and learning along with all of you, and am excited to be a part of this thang!""","Apr 30, 2016 10:13"

I am the author of The House of THOT, a blog about spirituality and mythical living which I hope to bring back to life soon. https://thehouseofthot.com. Plus I also run an Instagram account at @thehouseof. I see myself as a spiritual seeker with a weak spot for the archetypes of the Magician or the Druid. Which is why currently my path gravitates mostly around Hermeticism and Neodruidry, both Revival and (a tad) polytheist. I'm doing the Bardic course in the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids and the Dedicant Path in At nDraíocht Féin. Previously I've been a committed Catholic, studied Buddhism, Spiritualism, Daoism, Sufism and the likes, and even had an atheist phase. I work as a freelance copy/screen/ghostwriter and web developer. And as you all know, working in advertising sends you straight to hell. Meanwhile I like to be in my den at home playing urban hermit. Would love to build a career on top of my spiritual interests. Electronic, medieval, neofolk, post-punk music are my favourite genres, except for all the others. Eurovision Song Contest stuff for instance. I have always had a great curiosity for Tarot, but only got a deck for myself two years ago, and then I only started doing daily draws since March 1st. I tend to be on the more analytical side of things concerning what Tarot is supposed to do. I own a RWS deck and on my wish list are the Centennial, Wild Unknown and Hermetic Tarot decks.

I'm very much from the 'tarot as a tool for real life' school of thinking; for me, psychic ability and fortune telling are just not part of it at all, rather tarot has been an amazing tool for introspection, gaining some clarity on both the mundane and the big stuff, cutting through BS, and seeing what choices might be out there for us that we hadn't even considered before.

Plus I also run an Instagram account at @thehouseof. I see myself as a spiritual seeker with a weak spot for the archetypes of the Magician or the Druid.

I'm doing the Bardic course in the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids and the Dedicant Path in At nDraíocht Féin. Previously I've been a committed Catholic, studied Buddhism, Spiritualism, Daoism, Sufism and the likes, and even had an atheist phase. I work as a freelance copy/screen/ghostwriter and web developer. And as you all know, working in advertising sends you straight to hell. Meanwhile I like to be in my den at home playing urban hermit.

Eurovision Song Contest stuff for instance. I have always had a great curiosity for Tarot, but only got a deck for myself two years ago, and then I only started doing daily draws since March 1st.

Plus I also run an Instagram account at @thehouseof. I see myself as a spiritual seeker with a weak spot for the archetypes of the Magician or the Druid. Which is why currently my path gravitates mostly around Hermeticism and Neodruidry, both Revival and (a tad) polytheist. I'm doing the Bardic course in the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids and the Dedicant Path in At nDraíocht Féin. Previously I've been a committed Catholic, studied Buddhism, Spiritualism, Daoism, Sufism and the likes, and even had an atheist phase. I work as a freelance copy/screen/ghostwriter and web developer. And as you all know, working in advertising sends you straight to hell. Meanwhile I like to be in my den at home playing urban hermit. Would love to build a career on top of my spiritual interests. Electronic, medieval, neofolk, post-punk music are my favourite genres, except for all the others. Eurovision Song Contest stuff for instance. I have always had a great curiosity for Tarot, but only got a deck for myself two years ago, and then I only started doing daily draws since March 1st.
