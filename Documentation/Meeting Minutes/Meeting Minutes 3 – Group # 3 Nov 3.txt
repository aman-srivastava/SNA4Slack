Requirements and progress discussed 
1.	Overview of the architectural design of the project.
2.	Crawler acquires data without being detected as a bot using chrome drivers and selenium python library. Using Python version 2.7.
3.	Usage of apache-spark cluster computing framework in case the acquired data size crosses a couple of hundreds of GBs.
4.	Team is free to pick Gephi or NetworkX as long as it works. Can take a decision after creating a smallest prototype and see whose integration is successful and easier.
5.	Web services built on cassandra cluster, and successfully made rest api call. Presented it to the sponsor through localhost connecting to the google cloud. I simple user metric was shown and the pos presented the json data in hierarchical structure.
6.	Presented the front end design created using wireframe which the sponsor identified as good and professional. Will continue building upon this base to have the final visualizations.
