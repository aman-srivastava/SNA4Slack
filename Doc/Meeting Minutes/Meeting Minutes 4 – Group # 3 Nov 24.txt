Next Steps/Action items for 4th iteration 
1.	Setting up of NgXdashboard for the front end.
2.	Establishing the link between front end and cloud platform to build a sample angular component.
3.	Addition and execution of unit tests for networkX poc implementation
4.	Storing the metrices calculated from archives into the cloud database in a web service readable format.

Requirements and progress discussed 
1.	Crawler scaled up in a way where providing team name collects data from each channel of the team and updates to cassandra cluster at cloud platform. Presented the data through logging in to the Bitnami cassandra instance created at cloud. 
2.	Flask api code shown which is mapped with object relation entity and is integrated with slack spyder which executes the running of web service with provided urls.
3.	If cassandra provides latency, then we will used the csv file which the crawler is capable of generating autonomously from slack archive.
4.	Discussed the Neo4J prototype implementation which saves the data in graph database performing the metrics computations in real time.
5.	Enhanced the initial wireframe fitting in Social Network Analysis metrics.
6.	Presented the networkX library implementation which took 3-5 seconds for one team, calculated degree centralities and betweenness, and eventually generated the graph using matplotlib python library. 
7.	Discussed the ties used for graph representation building a “mention” model based on mentions of various users with an average of 70-80 mentions.
